## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Care Visit Auditor** is a serverless healthcare solution that automatically classifies care visit notes using AI to help healthcare providers prioritize patient care and identify urgent situations that require immediate attention.

### The Problem

Healthcare providers handle hundreds of care visit notes daily, making it challenging to:

- Quickly identify urgent situations requiring immediate attention
- Prioritize follow-up actions based on severity
- Ensure critical patient safety issues don't get overlooked
- Scale processing during high-volume periods

### The Solution

An AI-powered classification system that:

- ✅ Automatically processes care visit notes uploaded to S3
- 🔴 Classifies notes as **RED** (urgent), **AMBER** (moderate), or **GREEN** (routine)
- ⚡ Scales automatically using AWS Lambda's serverless architecture
- 📊 Stores results in DynamoDB for real-time dashboard access
- 🚀 Processes multiple records in parallel for optimal performance

## 🏗️ How AWS Lambda Powers This Application

### Lambda as the Core Processing Engine

**AWS Lambda serves as the heart of our application**, providing several key advantages:

#### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture**

- Lambda function is triggered automatically when care visit files are uploaded to S3
- No servers to manage - Lambda handles scaling, patching, and infrastructure management
- Pay-per-execution model ensures cost-effectiveness

#### 2. **Automatic Scaling**

- Lambda automatically scales to handle concurrent file uploads
- Each S3 upload triggers a separate Lambda execution
- Can process hundreds of files simultaneously without manual intervention

#### 3. **Serverless Benefits**

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    AWS Lambda handler triggered by S3 object creation,
    optimized for parallel processing of care visit notes.
    """
    for record in event['Records']:
        # Process each S3 upload event
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = unquote_plus(record['s3']['object']['key'])
        # ... classification logic
```

#### 4. **Parallel Processing Within Lambda**

Our Lambda function uses **ThreadPoolExecutor** to classify multiple visit notes concurrently:

```python
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = executor.map(process_record, tasks)
```

This approach maximizes Lambda's compute resources and significantly reduces processing time.

## 🔧 Architecture & AWS Services

### System Architecture

```
📁 S3 Upload → 🔔 S3 Event → ⚡ Lambda Function → 🤖 Bedrock AI → 💾 DynamoDB
```

### AWS Services Used

| Service                       | Role                    | Why It's Perfect for This Use Case                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **🔥 AWS Lambda**             | Core processing engine  | Serverless, event-driven, auto-scaling              |
| **📁 Amazon S3**              | File storage & triggers | Reliable storage with native Lambda integration     |
| **🤖 Amazon Bedrock**         | AI classification       | Managed AI service with healthcare-optimized models |
| **💾 Amazon DynamoDB**        | Results storage         | Fast NoSQL database for real-time access            |
| **🔔 S3 Event Notifications** | Trigger mechanism       | Seamless integration between S3 and Lambda          |

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Lambda Function Features

#### 1. **Intelligent Classification**

```python
def classify_visit_note(note):
    """Uses Amazon Bedrock Titan model to classify visit notes"""
    prompt = f"""You are a healthcare professional reviewing care visit notes.
    Please classify the following visit note into one of three categories:

    RED: Urgent/critical issues (safety concerns, medical emergencies)
    AMBER: Moderate concerns (health changes, care plan adjustments)
    GREEN: Routine visit (normal care delivery, positive outcomes)

    Visit Note: "{note.strip()}"
    """
```

#### 2. **Parallel Processing**

- Processes multiple visit notes simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Optimized for Lambda's concurrent execution limits
- Error handling ensures one failed record doesn't stop the entire batch

#### 3. **Efficient Data Storage**

- Batch writes to DynamoDB for optimal performance
- Structured data storage enables real-time querying
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

### Data Flow

1. **📁 File Upload**: Healthcare staff upload JSON files containing visit notes to S3
2. **🔔 Event Trigger**: S3 automatically triggers Lambda function
3. **⚡ Lambda Processing**: Function extracts and processes each visit note
4. **🤖 AI Classification**: Bedrock analyzes each note and assigns urgency level
5. **💾 Data Storage**: Results stored in DynamoDB with metadata
6. **📊 Access**: Healthcare teams access classified results via dashboard
